K14 - Poked around with more flask and html, this time focusing on html forms in tandem with flask and personal python modules

Predictions:
I predicted that the request obj and request.args methods would not work for the root page, since there is no request data to receive from user inputs

DISCO:
* Only request.args didn't work for the root page, request obj returns a dictionary called ImmutableMultiDict[]
* For the /auth page, the request obj returned ImmutableMultiDict[] with two key-value elements in them, while request.args['username'] returned the value of the 'username' element
* Forms are used in html to receive user input data
* methods=['GET', 'POST']) gave syntax errors
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q/C/C:
* What was the methods=['GET', 'POST']) portion meant to do?
* Why wasn't testmod0's methods used?
* So [__name__ == "__main__"] will be false when the script it is in is imported to another as a module?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


OTHER?
* modules are just external python scripts with methods inside them
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Question & Answer
Q: Is it runnable with all the commented-out lines re-enabled? If not, why/how?
A: For the root page, it is not runnable with all the commented lines re-enabled since one of the lines try accessing
the value of dictionary element with the key, "username," from the request object, that being an empty dictionary
called ImmutableMultiDict. Since it is empty, request.args['username'] does not work.
